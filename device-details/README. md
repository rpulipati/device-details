# Instructions to run the application

This is a spring boot application which will expose 2 GET endpoints
  GET -  get all devices (/devices)
  GET -  get a particular device details (/devices/{deviceId})

API can be accessed from `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#`

Server is returning some sample data (showed a couple ways here and can be implemented in various ways)

Implemented RestClient, which will run on scheduled basis (configured to run every 5 mins) and scheduler will
on application startup.

Added a few junits can be extended for various scenarios

### Improve the server implementation
We can store this data in either in RDBMS(Postgres, Aurora, Oracle etc) or NoSql DB (DynamoDB or MongoDB)

Consider if we go with DynamoDB
 - We can define HashKey on deviceId column and based on requirement we can define range column as well
 - We can implement few other endpoints (PUT/DELETE) to perform CRUD operations on this data and store this
 corresponding database
 - Device data can be stored in a single table, but it can be split into multiple tables based on requirements
 - We can sanitize the data before saving into DB
 - DB can be configured to be multi AZ(global tables) for a multi region deployments. Also we can enable snapshots
 and backup (helpful in case of DR Scenarios)
